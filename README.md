# SocialNetwork WebApplication

SocialNetwork is a platform built with a .NET Core Web API backend and a React.js frontend. The backend is implemented using a microservices architecture that integrates MassTransit with RabbitMQ for communication between microservices, applies the CQRS pattern with MediatR, features an API Gateway created with Ocelot and uses Xunit for unit testing.
